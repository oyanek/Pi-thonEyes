An understanding of the following concepts

- Try statements
- Basic circutry
- Breadboarding (i.e. how to use a breadboard and the resistors/wiring components associated)
- GPIO
- PIN interfacing

# Description

The goal of this project is to setup an HC-SR04 distance sensor as a 'Social Distance' checker. The sensor will measure a persons distance from the user and determine whether or not the person needs to distance more. If the person is violating social distance the program must also inform them of the distance they are required to backup. All measurements should be converted to inches and displayed as such.

1/5 pts. The program compiles and is uploaded to GitHub via the terminal

1/5 pts. The distance given by the sensor is converted correctly and displayed in the proper format

3/5 pts. The program gives an accurate measurement in both cases
